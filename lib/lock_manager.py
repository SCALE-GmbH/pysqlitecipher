    Plain SQLite does not ensure fairness when accessing database files. Each

    as other clients have only a small chance of getting a lock on the
    database file.

    When using PySQLite, a connection can have a lock manager associated which
    coordinates locking of the database. The lock manager can ensure fairness
    or give priority access to specific clients. It still has to use the
    original locking mechanism as a base to ensure protection against database
